# Brewster
Brewster is a multi-platform command line utility for all computer users. &nbsp;👍 It's still in development, features are likely flawed, buggy or just don't exist.  If you have something to add, create an issue [here](https://github.com/RevelMind/brewster/issues/new)

## Installation and Usage
You can install Brewster with the command line if you have NPM installed;
```sh
npm i -g brewster
```

This will enable you to use the `brewster` command, which starts up the Brewster terminal.
```sh
brewster # Running this command starts the Brewster terminal.
```

Run the `help` command in the Brewster terminal for a list of commands:
```
help # Lists all commands.
```
